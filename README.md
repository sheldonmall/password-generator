## Installation

There are no specific steps to install this website, nor are there any installable tools on this website, as of now.


## Usage 

This website is for a password generator tool. The usage of this PWGen tool is described below:

When the page loads, you will see `Click to Generate Password` button, and a `Your Secure Password` box beside it where your secure password will be displayed.

You start password generation process by following the steps given below:

* Click on the `Click to Generate Password` button. After this, you will be asked the following choices for your password:
- Specify the *length* for the password you desire. Valid choices are 8 to 256. You will be prompted to enter again if an incorrect choice is entered.
- Specify if you want to include **Uppercase** characters with a 'y' or a 'n'.
- Specify if you want to include **Lowercase** characters with a 'y' or a 'n'.
- Specify if you want to include **Numbers** with a 'y' or a 'n'.
- Specify if you want to include **Special** characters with a 'y' or a 'n'.
Code expects that minimum one of the above four will be selected as 'y'.
* The generated password meeting user specification will be displayed in the `Your Secure Password` box, which will be highlighed in Yellow now.
